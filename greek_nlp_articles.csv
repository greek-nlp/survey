As an example of a domain where multilingual capacity is crucial, we focus on Epidemic Surveillance. This task necessitates worldwide coverage of news in order to detect new events as quickly as possible, anywhere, whatever the language it is first reported in. In this study, text-genre is used rather than sentence analysis. The news-genre properties allow us to assess the thematic relevance of news, filtered with the help of a specialised lexicon that is automatically collected on Wikipedia. Afterwards, a more detailed analysis of text specific properties is applied to relevant documents to better characterize the epidemic event (i.e., which disease spreads where?). Results from 400 documents in each language demonstrate the interest of this multilingual approach with light resources. DAnIEL achieves an F 1-measure score around 85%. Two issues are addressed: the first is morphology rich languages, e.g. Greek, Polish and Russian as compared to English. The second is event location detection as related to disease detection. This system provides a reliable alternative to the generic IE architecture that is constrained by the lack of numerous components in many languages. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Its main contribution is its ability to extract epidemic events in any language, hence succeeding where state-of-the-art in surveillance systems usually fails: the objective of reactivity. Most systems indeed focus on a selected list of languages, deemed important. However, evidence shows that events are first described in the local language, and translated to other languages later, if and only if they contained important information. Hence, while systems handling only a sample of human languages may indeed succeed at extracting epidemic events, they will only do so after someone else detected the importance of the news, and made the decision to translate it. Thus, with events first described in other languages, such automated systems, that may only detect events that were already detected by humans, are essentially irrelevant for early detection. To overcome this weakness of the state-of-the-art in terms of reactivity, we designed a system that can detect epidemiological events in any language, without requiring any translation, be it automated or human-written. The solution presented in this paper relies on properties that may be called language universals. First, we observe and exploit properties of the news genre that remain unchanged, whatever the writing language. Second, we handle language variations, such as declensions, by processing text at the character-level, rather than at the word level. This additionally allows to handle various writing systems in a similar fashion. We present experiments with 5 languages, steoreotypical of different language families and writing systems: English, Chinese, Greek, Polish and Russian. Our system, DAnIEL, achieves an average F-measure score around 85%, slightly below top-performing systems for the languages that such systems are able to handle. However, its performance is superior for morphologically-rich languages. And it performs of course infinitely better for the languages that other systems are not able to handle: The richest system in the state-of-the-art handles around 10 languages, while there exists about 6,000 languages in the world, 300 of which are spoken by more than one million people. The DAnIEL system is able to process each of them. © 2013 IEEE."

In comparison to PAN-2013, a significantly larger corpus was built comprising hundreds of documents in four natural languages (Dutch, English, Greek, and Spanish) and four genres (essays, reviews, novels, opinion articles). In addition, more suitable performance measures are used focusing on the accuracy and the confidence of the predictions as well as the ability of the submitted methods to leave some problems unanswered in case there is great uncertainty. To this end, we adopt the c@1 measure, originally proposed for the question answering task. We received 13 software submissions that were evaluated in the TIRA framework. Analytical evaluation results are presented where one language-independent approach serves as a challenging baseline. Moreover, we continue the successful practice of the PAN labs to examine meta-models based on the combination of all submitted systems.

Especially after the introduction of the so-called web 2.0 and the explosion that followed regarding user generated content, the amount of data available over the internet has attracted the interest of both the scientific and business community. Their efforts focus on identifying the inner structures of data and the knowledge that can be derived by analyzing them. Web 2.0 is the subject of study and research in a number of areas. One of these areas is sentiment analysis, where the main goal is to study and draw conclusions about subjectivity, polarity and the feeling that is expressed in user generated content, which mainly consist of free text documents. The goal of this paper is to apply sentiment analysis on multilingual data, focusing on documents written in Greek. We developed an integrated framework that accepts user generated documents and then identifies the polarity of the text (neutral, negative or positive) and the sentiment expressed through it (joy, love, anger or sadness). We followed a semi-supervised approach which led to the development of two techniques for the automatic collection of training data without any human intervention. Our approach involves the detection and use of self-defining features that are available within the data. We take into account two emotionally rich features: a) emoticons and b) lists of emotionally intense keywords. These features are evaluated on data coming from a popular forum, using various classifiers and feature vectors. Our experimental results point to various conclusions about the effectiveness, advantages and limitations of applying such methods on Greek data. Using keywords we achieved 90[%] mean accuracy on identifying the subjectivity level and 93[%] on correctly identifying the polarity level, whereas using emoticons the mean accuracy for each of these levels was 74[%] and 77[%] respectively."

Moreover multilingual porting of speech applications increases the cost and complexity of the annotation task. In this paper we address the problem of transferring the semantic annotation of the source language corpus to a low-resource target language via crowdsourcing. The current crowdsourcing approach faces several problems. First, the available crowdsourcing platforms have skewed distribution of language speakers. Second, speech applications require domain-specific knowledge. Third, the lack of reference target language annotation, makes crowdsourcing worker control very difficult. In this paper we address these issues on the task of cross-language transfer of domain-specific semantic annotation from an Italian spoken language corpus to Greek, via targeted crowdsourcing. The issue of domain knowledge transfer is addressed by priming the workers with the source language concepts. The lack of reference annotation is coped with a consensus-based annotation algorithm. The quality of annotation transfer is assessed using source language references and inter-annotator agreement. We demonstrate that the proposed computational methodology is viable and achieves acceptable annotation quality."

The genres of data are often referred to the shifts of text topics and new languages domains. Although new detection models can be retrained for different languages or new text genres, previous model has to be thrown away and the creation process has to be restarted from scratch. In this paper, we present a multilingual sentence boundary detection system (iSentenizer-) for Danish, German, English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Finnish, and Swedish languages. The proposed system is able to detect the sentence boundaries of a mixture of different text genres and languages with high accuracy. We employ i +Learning algorithm, an incremental tree learning architecture, for constructing the system. iSentenizer-, under the incremental learning framework, is adaptable to text of different topics and Roman-alphabet languages, by merging new data into existing model to learn the new knowledge incrementally by revision instead of retraining.

The challenge in processing languages with richer morphology than English, lies in reducing estimation error while addressing the semantic distortion introduced by a stemmer or a lemmatiser. For this purpose, we propose a methodology for selective stemming, based on a semantic distortion metric. The proposed algorithm is tested on the task of similarity estimation between words using two types of corpus-based similarity metrics: co-occurrence-based and context-based. The performance on morphologically rich languages is boosted by stemming with the context-based metric, unlike English, where the best results are obtained by the co-occurrence-based metric. A key finding is that the estimation error reduction is different when a word is used as a feature, rather than when it is used as a target word."

In contrast, current computer applications are still lacking the ability to disambiguate complex texts efficiently. The most common type of ambiguity is lexical ambiguity, and this is noticed even in highly inflectional languages such as Greek. In the present article, all the patterns of predictable lexical ambiguity in Modern Greek Language are registered, verified and quantified as occurred in the Neurolingo computational lexicon, after a study of morpho-syntactic characteristics that differentiate the ambiguous words."

We present here a system to extract epidemic events in potentially any language, provided a Wikipedia seed for common disease names exists. Methods: The Daniel system presented herein relies on properties that are common to news writing (the journalistic genre), the most useful being repetition and saliency. Wikipedia is used to screen common disease names to be matched with repeated characters strings. Language variations, such as declensions, are handled by processing text at the character-level, rather than at the word level. This additionally makes it possible to handle various writing systems in a similar fashion. Material: As no multilingual ground truth existed to evaluate the Daniel system, we built a multilingual corpus from the Web, and collected annotations from native speakers of Chinese, English, Greek, Polish and Russian, with no connection or interest in the Daniel system. This data set is available online freely, and can be used for the evaluation of other event extraction systems. Results: Experiments for 5 languages out of 17 tested are detailed in this paper: Chinese, English, Greek, Polish and Russian. The Daniel system achieves an average F-measure of 82% in these 5 languages. It reaches 87% on BE. corpus, the state-of-the-art corpus in English, slightly below top-performing systems, which are tailored with numerous language-specific resources. The consistent performance of Daniel on multiple languages is an important contribution to the reactivity and the coverage of epidemiological event detection systems. Conclusions: Most event extraction systems rely on extensive resources that are language-specific. While their sophistication induces excellent results (over 90% precision and recall), it restricts their coverage in terms of languages and geographic areas. In contrast, in order to detect epidemic events in any language, the Daniel system only requires a list of a few hundreds of disease names and locations, which can actually be acquired automatically. The system can perform consistently well on any language, with precision and recall around 82% on average, according to this paper's evaluation. Daniel's character-based approach is especially interesting for morphologically-rich and low-resourced languages. The lack of resources to be exploited and the state of the art string matching algorithms imply that Daniel can process thousands of documents per minute on a simple laptop. In the context of epidemic surveillance, reactivity and geographic coverage are of primary importance, since no one knows where the next event will strike, and therefore in what vernacular language it will first be reporteDBy being able to process any language, the Daniel system offers unique coverage for poorly endowed languages, and can complete state of the art techniques for major languages."
A Cross-Lingual Similarity Measure For Detecting Biomedical Term Translations,PLoS ONE,2015-06-01,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126196,"Danushka Tarupathi Bollegala, Georgios Kontonatsios, Sophia Ananiadou",Term Translations Detection,Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP,n/a,"Modern Greek, English, French, Spanish, Japanese",6,14,research,Journal,Article,,,Scopus,TITLE-ABS({Greek}) AND ALL({Natural Language Processing}) AND PUBYEAR > 2011,24/10/2023,2,"© 2015 Bollegala et al.

Often a biomedical term is first proposed in English and later it is manually translated to other languages. Despite the fact that there are large monolingual lexicons of biomedical terms, only a fraction of those term lexicons are translated to other languages. Manually compiling large-scale bilingual dictionaries for technical domains is a challenging task because it is difficult to find a sufficiently large number of bilingual experts. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure for detecting most similar translation candidates for a biomedical term specified in one language (source) from another language (target). Specifically, a biomedical term in a language is represented using two types of features: (a) intrinsic features that consist of character n-grams extracted from the term under consideration, and (b) extrinsic features that consist of unigrams and bigrams extracted from the contextual windows surrounding the term under consideration. We propose a cross-lingual similarity measure using each of those feature types. First, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space in each language, we propose prototype vector projection (PVP) - a non-negative lower-dimensional vector projection method. Second, we propose a method to learn a mapping between the feature spaces in the source and target language using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The proposed method requires only a small number of training instances to learn a cross-lingual similarity measure. The proposed PVP method outperforms popular dimensionality reduction methods such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a nearest neighbor prediction task. Moreover, our experimental results covering several language pairs such as English-French, English-Spanish, English-Greek, and English-Japanese show that the proposed method outperforms several other feature projection methods in biomedical term translation prediction tasks."

Arguments can be usually decomposed into a claim and one or more premises justifying it. The proposed approach tries to identify segments that represent argument elements (claims and premises) on social Web texts (mainly news and blogs) in the Greek language, for a small set of thematic domains, including articles on politics, economics, culture, various social issues, and sports. The proposed approach exploits distributed representations of words, extracted from a large non-annotated corpus. Among the novel aspects of this work is the thematic domain itself which relates to social Web, in contrast to traditional research in the area, which concentrates mainly on law documents and scientific publications. The huge increase of social web communities, along with their user tendency to debate, makes the identification of arguments in these texts a necessity. In addition, a new manually annotated corpus has been constructed that can be used freely for research purposes. Evaluation results are quite promising, suggesting that distributed representations can contribute positively to the task of argument extraction."

Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous contextfree grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this paper explores extending translation rules with high quality and increased coverage in three ways. First, we introduce structure informed non-terminals, better guiding the parsing in favor of well formed structure, instead of using a uninformed non-terminal in SCFGs. Second, we examine the difference between word alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. Finally, we address the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules. Evaluation on the standard GeoQuery benchmark dataset shows that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art across various languages, including English, German and Greek."

Various context-based semantic similarity metrics are investigated using contextual features that include both words and character n-grams. The model produces continuous affective ratings in three dimensions (valence, arousal and dominance) for all five languages, achieving consistent performance. We achieve classification accuracy (valence polarity task) between 85% and 91% for all five languages.

According to existing studies, the results of similar tasks are heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of dictionaries for linguistic preprocessing, entity discovery and sentiment analysis. Additionally, noise reduction is achieved with methods for sarcasm detection and correction. Here we report on the application of these methods on the complete corpus of tweets regarding two local electoral events of worldwide impact: the Greek referendum of 2015 and the subsequent legislative elections. To this end, we compiled novel dictionaries for sentiment and entity detection for the Greek language tailored to these events. We subsequently performed volume analysis, sentiment analysis and sarcasm correction. Results showed that there was a strong anti-austerity sentiment accompanied with a critical view on European and Greek political actions."

The central concept of our method is a model, which is trained with Dutch, English, Greek, Spanish and German text documents. The model sets for each language specific parameters and a threshold that accepts or rejects the alleged author as A. The proposed method offers a wide range of benefits, e.g., a universal (static) threshold for each language and scalability regarding almost any involved component (classification function, ensemble strategy, features, etc.). Furthermore, the method benefits from low runtime due to the fact that no natural language processing techniques nor other computationally-intensive methods are involved. In our experiments, we applied the method on 28 test corpora including 4525 verification cases across 16 genres and a huge number of mixed topics, where we achieved competitive results (75% median accuracy).

This tool carries out the function of analyzing morphologically and syntactically sentences, phrases, and words in order to correct syntactic, grammatical, and stylistic errors (Iordanidou, 1999, 2004). Our premise in order to deal with all these issues is the settings of Grammar (adaptation of Little Modern Grammar of Manolis Triantafyllidis), which is the formal grammatical codification of Modern Greek, since 1976 (Triantafyllidis, 1991). This paper also presents the formalism used (the Mnemosyne), a formalism that handles with the particularities of the Greek language that hinder the computational processing. This formalism has already been used to identify multi-word terms and to phrase grammars, aiming to automatically extract information. We tested the Greek grammar checker by giving texts that were to be evaluated both to the grammar checker and to a person. In the majority of cases, the human corrector accuracy is almost equal to the grammar checker one. As far as mistakes that have to do with the coherence of the text or with meaning are concerned, the human corrector was the only accurate corrector, not the grammar checker one (Gakis, 2015)."

It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier. Accordingly, we apply gradient boosting machines, an ensemble algorithm that can learn with different loss functions providing the ability to work efficiently with high dimensional data. Moreover, for the task at hand, we deal with a class imbalance issues since the distribution of sentiments in real-world applications often displays issues of inequality. For example, in political forums or electronic discussions about immigration or religion, negative comments overwhelm the positive ones. The class imbalance problem was confronted using a hybrid technique that performs a variation of under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class, respectively. Experimental results, considering different settings, such as translation of tokens against translation of sentences, consideration of limited Greek text preprocessing and omission of the translation phase, demonstrated that the proposed gradient boosting framework can effectively cope with both high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets and performs significantly better than a plethora of traditional machine learning classification approaches in terms of precision and recall measures."

Such a system can be beneficial for online services, companies recommendations, and social support communities. The main contributions of this work are to: (a) detect primary emotions, social ones, and those that characterize general affective states from online text sources, (b) compare and validate different emotional analysis processes to highlight those that are most efficient, and (c) provide a proof of concept case study to monitor and validate online activity, both explicitly and implicitly.

According to existing studies, the results of similar tasks are heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of dictionaries for linguistic preprocessing, entity discovery and sentiment analysis. Additionally, noise reduction is achieved with methods for sarcasm detection and correction. Here we report on the application of these methods on the complete corpus of tweets regarding two local electoral events of worldwide impact: the Greek referendum of 2015 and the subsequent legislative elections. To this end, we compiled novel dictionaries for sentiment and entity detection for the Greek language tailored to these events. We subsequently performed volume analysis, sentiment analysis, sarcasm correction and topic modeling. Results showed that there was a strong anti-austerity sentiment accompanied with a critical view on European and Greek political actions."

This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people's opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents’ vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case."

Moreover, based on a simple rule we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer or when the attribution scheme is unable to make a decision with a high degree of certainty. Evaluations based on 6 test collections (PAN CLEF 2014 evaluation campaign) indicate that Spatium-L1 usually appears in the top 3 best verification systems, and on an aggregate measure, presents the best performance.

An ingestion module enables the semi/automatic construction of the data dictionary that is used for question answering whereas the Greek Language Dictionary, the Syntactic and the Semantic Rules are also stored in an internal, extensible knowledge base. After the ingestion phase, the system is accepting questions in natural language, and automatically constructs the corresponding relational algebra query to be further evaluated by the external database. The results are then formulated as free text and returned to the user. We highlight the unique features of our system with respect to the Greek language and we present its implementation and a preliminary evaluation.

Our purpose is the automatic differentiation between literal and metaphorical meaning in authentic non-annotated phrases from the Corpus of Greek Texts by means of computational methods of machine learning. For this purpose the theoretical background of distributional semantics is discussed and employed. Distributional Semantics Theory develops concepts and methods for the quantification and classification of semantic similarities displayed by linguistic elements in large amounts of linguistic data according to their distributional properties. In accordance with this model, the approach followed in the current work takes into account the linguistic context for the computation of the distributional representation of phrases in geometrical space, as well as for their comparison with the distributional representations of other phrases, whose function in speech is already ""known"" with the objective to reach conclusions about their literal or metaphorical function in the specific linguistic context. This procedure aims at dealing with the lack of linguistic resources for the Greek language, as the almost impossible up to now semantic comparison between ""phrases"", takes the form of an arithmetical comparison of their distributional representations in geometrical space."

In this paper, we examine both ideology expressed and practices employed by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November (hereafter 17N) that operated in Greece between the years of 1975 and 2002. Within this line of thought, we will focus on the ideological justification, ethical standing and deployment of the terrorist operations as presented in the communiqués published by 17N, emphasizing on the use of hate speech as a means of justifying their choices and actions, as well as a way of reaching out to Greek people. To decide on how the automatic classification will be performed, we experimented with different text analyzing techniques such as critical discourse and content analysis and based on the preliminary results of these techniques a classification algorithm is proposed that can classify the communiqués in three categories depending on the presence of hate speech. The methodology was tested over the existing dataset with all the communiqués and the corresponding results are discussed."

For this work, we use unstructured text data, collected from the web, written in French, English and Greek (a less opinion-present language). The incorporate corpus-based input is raw, used without any pre-processing, translation, annotation nor additional knowledge features. For the machine learning approach, we use two different deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CONVNETS) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The learning model exploits n-gram level information, and achieves high accuracy for sentiment polarity and topics classification according to the experimental tests and results. From our hypothesis, we argue that the multilingual environment composed of reviews in semantically close domains, does not impact the network performance, and lead us to deduce that semantic features extraction with ConvNets and RNNs are language and context independent. Following these results, we tend to promote the inception of simple yet powerful approach for feeding deep networks in multilingual context."

Regarding internal control, several research studies address the issue of internal audit quality. Noteworthy, according to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) the internal controls over financial reporting are assessed by the auditors and the management. In the present study, we assess internal controls over financial reporting by employing Text Mining techniques. We analyse the annual reports of 133 publicly traded Greek Companies. The textual parts of the annual reports that refer to internal audit mechanism are extracted. We adopt a Vector Space model and the term-document matrix records the occurrence frequencies of the terms. By applying feature selection, a set of significant keywords, which are used as predictors, is extracted. The Linear Regression model developed explains the variance of the data and highlights significant predictors. The model manages to successfully assess the internal audit function. By performing PCA, major underlying procedures and concepts related to internal audit quality are revealed. Inspite of the undoubted importance of the assessment of internal audit, no previous attempt has been made to assess internal audit and to extract internal audit information from corporate disclosures by using Text Mining techniques.

A novel rule based machine translation scheme from Greek to Greek Sign Language: Production of different types of large corpora and Language Models evaluation,Computer Speech & Language,,2018,,"Kouremenos, D., Ntalianis, K., & Kollias, S.",Rule-Based Machine Translation,Machine Translation,Machine translation; Greek Sign Language; GSL; Deaf people communication,"Modern Greek, Greek Sign Language",,18,research,,,,,Google Scholar,"""toxicity detection"" greek nlp",11/23/2023,quality_assurance,"One of the aims of assistive technologies is to help people with disabilities to communicate with others and to provide means of access to information. As an aid to Deaf people, in this work we present a novel prototype Rule Based Machine Translation (RBMT) system for the creation of large and quality written Greek Sign Language (GSL) glossed corpora from Greek text. In particular, the proposed RBMT system assists the professional GSL translator in speeding up the production of different kinds of GSL glossed corpora. Then each glossed corpus is used for the production/creation of Language Model (LM) n-grams. With the GSL glossed corpus from Greek text, we can build, test and evaluate different kinds of Language Models for different kinds of glossed GSL corpora. Here, it should be noted that it does not require grammar knowledge of GSL but only very basic GSL phenomena covered by manual RBMT rules as it assists the professional human translator. Furthermore, it should also be stressed that Language Models for written GSL gloss are missing from the scientific literature, thus this work is pioneer in this field. Evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out for the weather reports domain, where 20,284 tokens and 1000 sentences have been produced. By using the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric score, our prototype RBMT system achieves a relative score of 0.84 (84%) for 4-grams and 0.9 (90%) for 1-grams."

The greek version of the spaCy platform was added into the source code, a feature that did not exist before our contribution, and was used for building the models. Additionally, a part of speech tagger was trained that can detect the morphology of the tokens and performs higher than the state-of-the-art results when classifying only the part of speech. For named entity recognition using spaCy, a model that extends the standard ENAMEX type (organization, location, person) was built. Certain experiments that were conducted indicate the need for flexibility in out-of-vocabulary words and there is an effort for resolving this issue. Finally, the evaluation results are discussed."

We introduce XLDA, cross-lingual data augmentation, a method that replaces a segment of the input text with its translation in another language. XLDA enhances performance of all 14 tested languages of the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark. With improvements of up to $4.8\%$, training with XLDA achieves state-of-the-art performance for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. XLDA is in contrast to, and performs markedly better than, a more naive approach that aggregates examples in various languages in a way that each example is solely in one language. On the SQuAD question answering task, we see that XLDA provides a $1.0\%$ performance increase on the English evaluation set. Comprehensive experiments suggest that most languages are effective as cross-lingual augmentors, that XLDA is robust to a wide range of translation quality, and that XLDA is even more effective for randomly initialized models than for pretrained models."

Among the research findings are that many different methods will work, including a number of methods that are superficially language-independent (such as an analysis of the most common “words” or “character n-grams” in a document). Since all languages have words (and all written languages have characters), this method could (in theory) work on any language. However, it is not clear that the methods that work best on, for example English, would also work best on other languages. It is not even clear that the same level of performance is achievable in different languages, even under identical conditions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve “identical conditions” in practice. A new corpus, developed by George Mikros, provides very tight controls not only for author but also for topic, thus enabling a direct comparison of performance levels between the two languages Greek and English. We compare a number of different methods head-to-head on this corpus, and show that, overall, performance on English is higher than performance on Greek, often highly significantly so."

We apply two state of the art architectures, Random Forest (RF) and Deeplearnig4j (DL4J), to our data (which constitute three translation outputs). To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning architectures are applied to the automatic selection of parallel data. We also propose new string-based features that seem to be effective for the classifier, and we investigate whether an attribute selection method could be used for better classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate an increase of up to 4% (compared to our previous work) using RF and rather satisfactory results using DL4J."

An additional challenge refers to the exploitation and correlation of data from different languages, in order to analyse sentiments by considering all available information in a holistic way. This paper investigates the impact of Neural Machine Translation in sentiment analysis, based on the translation of text for which neural sentiment analysis in English has been already applied and is applied again on the translated German and Greek texts. The latter is performed through the same Neural Network models that were used in the original language, in order to analyse the differences between the performed neural sentiment analysis on the source and the target languages. The outcomes of the proposed approach have a twofold interpretation. While, it is concluded that modern Neural Machine Translation tools are mature enough to provide high accuracy translations and have minor impact on multilingual sentiment analysis, on the other hand it is shown that additional research should be performed on the multilingualism that pre-trained Word Embeddings can provide."

One such task is assigning sentiment polarity labels to the vertices of a large social network based on local ground truth state vectors containing structural, functional, and affective attributes. Emotions have been long identified as key factors in the overall social network resiliency and determining such labels robustly would be a major indicator of it.

By analyzing learners' actions and extracting data related to their learning behavior, educators can specify proper learning approaches to stimulate learners' interest and contribute to constructive monitoring of learning progress during the course or to improve future courses. Learners-generated content and their feedback and comments can provide indicative information about the educational procedures that they attended and the training activities that they participated in. Educational systems must possess mechanisms to analyze learners' comments and automatically specify their opinions and attitude towards the courses and the learning activities that are offered to them. This paper describes a Greek language sentiment analysis system that analyzes texts written in Greek language and generates feature vectors which together with classification algorithms give us the opportunity to classify Greek texts based on the personal opinion and the degree of satisfaction expressed. The sentiment analysis module has been integrated into the hybrid educational systems of the Greek school network that offers life-long learning courses. The module offers a wide range of possibilities to lecturers, policymakers and educational institutes that participate in the training procedure and offers life-long learning courses, to understand how their learners perceive learning activities and specify what aspects of the learning activities they liked and disliked. The experimental study show quite interesting results regarding the performance of the sentiment analysis methodology and the specification of users' opinions and satisfaction. The feature analysis demonstrates interesting findings regarding the characteristics that provide indicative information for opinion analysis and embeddings combined with deep learning approaches yield satisfactory results."

All rights reserved.Sentiment analysis is a developing field dealing with the detection of sentiments or opinions expressed in a written text. In an age where online services are subject to immediate feedback by users and clients, sentiment analysis on bodies of online reviews is of particular interest to service-oriented businesses such as hospitality establishments. Methods based on Machine Learning are very widely used for this purpose. While some standardized methodologies exist, the sheer volume of data on which the analysis is to be performed in order to train a Deep Learning network, makes it important to come up with designs that are sufficiently complex so as to accurately detect sentiment but also simple enough so as to be scalable and efficient in terms of performance. In this paper, we examine trade-offs of accuracy versus efficiency by performing sentiment analysis on an annotated body of review texts collected from online hotel reserving resources. The reviews we use to train our Deep Learning models are pre-processed by a tool which uses linguistic rules to add sentiment tags to words and expressions in the text. The tags express sentiment polarity, i.e. whether the expression is positive or negative. We propose four different DL network designs, which receive as training input either the review texts, the review texts plus some information on the tag annotation, or the annotation of the text alone, and we present the trade-offs that each setup offers."

The artificial neural network with adaptive behavior exploited for language learning (ANNABELL) model, is a large-scale neural network, however, unlike most deep learning methods that solve natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it does not represent an empirical engineering solution for specific NLP problems; rather, its organization complies with findings from cognitive neuroscience, particularly the multicompartment working memory models. The system is appropriately trained to understand the level of cognitive development required for language acquisition and the robustness achieved in learning simultaneously four languages, using a corpus of text-based exchanges of developmental complexity. The selected languages, Greek, Italian and Albanian, besides English, differ significantly in structure and complexity. Initially, the system was validated in each language alone and was then compared with the open-ended cumulative training, in which languages are learned jointly, prior to querying with random language at random order. We aimed to assess if the model could learn the languages together to the same degree of skill as learning each apart. Moreover, we explored the generalization skill in multilingual context questions and the ability to elaborate a short text of preschool literature. We verified if the system could follow a dialogue coherently and cohesively, keeping track of its previous answers and recalling them in subsequent queries. The results show that the architecture developed broad language processing functionalities, with satisfactory performances in each language trained singularly, maintaining high accuracies when they are acquired cumulatively."

In this respect, various tools have been developed by interested parties (companies, individuals) that monitor the social media pulse with respect to various topics (products, persons, organizations, etc) in order to detect the stance, either positive or negative, and the overall emotion in the textual content of social media posts and comments. Despite the success of machine learning models for related tasks in popular languages (e.g. English), little progress has been made in under-represented languages, such as Greek. Based on this reality, in this work, we capitalize on the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architectures for emotion detection in social media textual content written in the Greek language. For this purpose, a relevant corpus is initially collected and annotated. Then, two pre-trained BERT models for the Greek language are employed, one of which has been proposed by the authors of the current work in previous publications. Both models are further trained on the collected corpus and are subsequently used in architectures that classify short social media texts in one or more emotion classes. The obtained results indicate that the BERT-based models outperform other approaches, especially those based on emotion lexicons."

We perform our analysis on datasets carefully designed to reflect different sense distributions, and control for parameters that are highly correlated with polysemy such as frequency and grammatical category. We demonstrate that BERT-derived representations reflect words’ polysemy level and their partitionability into senses. Polysemy-related information is more clearly present in English BERT embeddings, but models in other languages also manage to establish relevant distinctions between words at different polysemy levels. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the knowledge encoded in contextualized representations and open up new avenues for multilingual lexical semantics research."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As the amount of content that is created on social media is constantly increasing, more and more opinions and sentiments are expressed by people in various subjects. In this respect, sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques can be valuable for the automatic analysis of huge textual corpora (comments, reviews, tweets etc.). Despite the advances in text mining algorithms, deep learning techniques, and text representation models, the results in such tasks are very good for only a few high-density languages (e.g., English) that possess large training corpora and rich linguistic resources; nevertheless, there is still room for improvement for the other lower-density languages as well. In this direction, the current work employs various language models for representing social media texts and text classifiers in the Greek language, for detecting the polarity of opinions expressed on social media. The experimental results on a related dataset collected by the authors of the current work are promising, since various classifiers based on the language models (naive bayesian, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, deep feed-forward neural networks) outperform those of word or sentence-based embeddings (word2vec, GloVe), achieving a classification accuracy of more than 80%. Additionally, a new language model for Greek social media has also been trained on the aforementioned dataset, proving that language models based on domain specific corpora can improve the performance of generic language models by a margin of 2%.

Tweets were recorded over four time periods. NodeXL Pro was used to identify word pairs, create semantic networks, and analyze them. A lexicon-based sentiment analysis was also performed. The main topics of conversation were extracted. “New cases” are heavily discussed throughout, showing fear of transmission of the virus in the commu-nity. Mood analysis showed fluctuations in mood over time. Positive emotions weakened and negative emotions increased. Fear is the dominant sentiment.

The linguistic features are string based for the language pairs English (EN)–Greek (EL) and EN–Italian (IT). The paper also explores the linguistic differences that affect evaluation accuracy between different kinds of corpora. A comparative study between using a simple embedding layer (mathematically calculated) and pre-trained embeddings is conducted. Moreover, an analysis of the impact of feature selection and dimensionality reduction on classification accuracy has been conducted. Results show that using a neural network (NN) model with different input representations produces results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art for MT evaluation for EN–EL and EN–IT, by an increase of almost 0.40 points in correlation with human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation. It is observed that the proposed algorithm achieved better results on noisy and small datasets. In addition, for a more integrated analysis of the accuracy results, a qualitative linguistic analysis has been carried out in order to address complex linguistic phenomena."

We analyze textbook corpora for different school subjects and textbooks for Greek as a Second Language, covering a very wide spectrum of school age groups and proficiency levels. A broad range of quantifiable linguistic complexity features (lexical, morphological and syntactic) are extracted and calculated. Conducting experiments with different feature subsets, we show that the different linguistic dimensions contribute orthogonal information, each contributing towards the highest result achieved using all linguistic feature subsets. A readability classifier trained on this basis reaches a classification accuracy of 88.16% for the Greek as a Second Language corpus. To investigate the generalizability of the classification models, we also perform cross-corpus evaluations. We show that the model trained on the most varied text collection (for Greek as a school subject) generalizes best. In addition to advancing the state of the art for Greek readability analysis, the paper also contributes insights on the role of different feature sets and training setups for generalizable readability classification."

In this paper, we study ethnic bias and how it varies across languages by analyzing and mitigating ethnic bias in monolingual BERT for English, German, Spanish, Korean, Turkish, and Chinese. To observe and quantify ethnic bias, we develop a novel metric called Categorical Bias score. Then we propose two methods for mitigation; first using a multilingual model, and second using contextual word alignment of two monolingual models. We compare our proposed methods with monolingual BERT and show that these methods effectively alleviate the ethnic bias. Which of the two methods works better depends on the amount of NLP resources available for that language. We additionally experiment with Arabic and Greek to verify that our proposed methods work for a wider variety of languages."

The semantic frames approach to lexicon building and semantic representation of meaning at word and phrase level - or even beyond - has been the focus of research in computational linguistics and in Natural Language Processing. The present paper is aimed at describing completed work for the creation of a domain-specific frame-semantic lexicon in Greek (EL) and its alignment to the English (EN) FrameNet. Building on Fillmore’s Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1977, 1982, 1985) and on the example set by the FrameNet project (Baker et al. 1998), we developed a bilingual EL-EN lexical resource in the financial domain based on corpus evidence. Our motivation was two-fold: (a) to better account for the semantics of the specialized lexicon - especially the verbs and predicative nouns of the financial domain, and (b) to make cross-lingual alignments at the word level in a way that is meaningful for the translation process."

For this reason, several researchers are already working on the development of prototypes that allow for the detection of cyberhate automatically and on a large scale. However, most of them are developed to detect hate only in English, and very few focus specifically on racism and xenophobia, the category of discrimination in which the most hate crimes are recorded each year. In addition, ad hoc datasets manually generated by several trained coders are rarely used in the development of these prototypes since almost all researchers use already available datasets. The objective of this research is to overcome the limitations of those previous works by developing and evaluating classification models capable of detecting racist and/or xenophobic hate speech being spread online, first in Spanish, and later in Greek and Italian. In the development of these prototypes, three differentiated machine learning strategies are tested. First, various traditional shallow learning algorithms are used. Second, deep learning is used, specifically, an ad hoc developed RNN model. Finally, a BERT-based model is developed in which transformers and neural networks are used. The results confirm that deep learning strategies perform better in detecting anti-immigration hate speech online. It is for this reason that the deep architectures were the ones finally improved and tested for hate speech detection in Greek and Italian and in multisource. The results of this study represent an advance in the scientific literature in this field of research, since up to now, no online anti-immigration hate detectors had been tested in these languages and using this type of deep architecture."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Modern businesses are obligated to conform to regulations to prevent physical injuries and ill health for anyone present on a site under their responsibility, such as customers, employees and visitors. Safety officers (SOs) are engineers, who perform site audits to businesses, record observations regarding possible safety issues and make appropriate recommendations. In this work, we develop a multimodal machine-learning architecture for the analysis and categorization of safety observations, given textual descriptions and images taken from the location sites. For this, we utilize a new multimodal dataset, Safety4All, which contains 5344 safety-related observations created by 86 SOs in 486 sites. An observation consists of a short issue description, written by the SOs, accompanied with images where the issue is shown, relevant metadata and a priority score. Our proposed architecture is based on the joint fine tuning of large pretrained language and image neural network models. Specifically, we propose the use of a joint task and contrastive loss, which aligns the text and vision representations in a joint multimodal space. The contrastive loss ensures that inter-modality representation distances are maintained, so that vision and language representations for similar samples are close in the shared multimodal space. We evaluate the proposed model on three tasks, namely, priority classification of input observations, observation assessment and observation categorization. Our experiments show that inspection scene images and textual descriptions provide complementary information, signifying the importance of both modalities. Furthermore, the use of the joint contrastive loss produces strong multimodal representations and outperforms a baseline simple model in tasks fusion. In addition, we train and release a large transformer-based language model for the Greek language based on the Electra architecture."

Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining applications on websites and the social media range from product reviews and brand reception to political issues and the stock market. The vast majority of the research in sentiment analysis has mostly dealt with English data, where there’s an abundance of readily available and annotated for sentiment corpora. With a few notable exceptions, the research in other minor languages such as Greek is lacking. This paper deals with sentiment analysis of electronic product reviews written in Greek. To this end, a small dataset of 480 positive and negative reviews is compiled and used, taken from the popular Greek e-commerce website, www.skroutz.gr.

For the Greek language, most of the existing phonetic algorithms provide rather insufficient support. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce an algorithm for phonetic matching designed for the Greek language: we start from the original Soundex and we redesign and extend it for accommodating the Greek language's phonetic rules, ending up to a family of algorithms, that we call <![CDATA[ ${\tt Soundex}_{GR}$ ]]>. Then, we report various experimental results showcasing how the algorithm behaves in different scenarios, and we provide comparative results for various parameters of the algorithm for revealing the trade-off between precision and recall in datasets with different kinds of errors. We also provide comparative results with matching using stemming, full phonemic transcription, and edit distance, that demonstrate that <![CDATA[ ${\tt Soundex}_{GR}$ ]]> performs better (indicatively, it achieves F-Score over 95% in collections of similar-sounded words). The simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm make it applicable and adaptable to a wide range of tasks."

With the advances in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, there has been an increasing interest in applying such assistants in new areas and with new capabilities. In particular, their application in e-healthcare is becoming attractive and is driven by the need to access medically-related knowledge, as well as providing first-level assistance in an efficient manner. In such types of virtual assistants, localization is of utmost importance, since the general population (especially the aging population) is not familiar with the needed “healthcare vocabulary” to communicate facts properly; and state-of-practice proves relatively poor in performance when it comes to specialized virtual assistants for less frequently spoken languages. In this context, we present a Greek ML-based virtual assistant specifically designed to address some commonly occurring tasks in the healthcare domain, such as doctor’s appointments or distress (panic situations) management. We build on top of an existing open-source framework, discuss the necessary modifications needed to address the language-specific characteristics and evaluate various combinations of word embeddings and machine learning models to enhance the assistant’s behaviour. Results show that we are able to build an efficient Greek-speaking virtual assistant to support e-healthcare, while the NLP pipeline proposed can be applied in other (less frequently spoken) languages, without loss of generality."

In particular, it receives a question either in Greek or in English language, and by exploiting Named Entity Recognition models for recognizing the entity of the question, the DBpedia abstracts written in the mentioned languages for the identified entity, Machine Translation (MT) tools, and BERT QA models (pretrained in English corpus), it produces the final answer. Concerning the evaluation, we provide experimental results about the effectiveness and efficiency of MT and QA process by using a Greek evaluation collection, and we present statistics of DBpedia abstracts and several use cases with real examples."

We therefore investigate cross-lingual knowledge transfer strategies to execute this task for clinics that do not use the English language and have a small amount of in-domain data available. We evaluate these strategies for a Greek and a Spanish clinic leveraging clinical notes from different clinical domains such as cardiology, oncology and the ICU. Our results reveal two strategies that outperform the state-of-the-art: Translation-based methods in combination with domain-specific encoders and cross-lingual encoders plus adapters. We find that these strategies perform especially well for classifying rare phenotypes and we advise on which method to prefer in which situation. Our results show that using multilingual data overall improves clinical phenotyping models and can compensate for data sparseness."

NMT systems have been used particularly for the translation of technical and life science texts with short, repetitive, formulaic, and unambiguous sentence types. In contrast, legal translation studies scholars have depicted legal translation as not particularly compatible with MT, mainly because legal texts include features that pose significant challenges to MT (Killman, 2014; Prieto Ramos, 2015; Matthiesen, 2017). As such, the quality of the output varies according to the legal genre and language pair. Using MQM-DQF error typology, this study evaluates the quality of the post-edited and human translation (HT) products of two normative property law texts from Greek to English, a language pair considered to be under-resourced. The time taken by the two translators who participated in the study to complete these products was monitored, and information was collected on their attitudes towards MT and post-editing (PE). The findings indicate neither productivity gains in the case of PE, nor major differences in accuracy or fluency between the post-edited and HT texts, although the number of errors was slightly higher overall in the case of HT, with most occurring at the level of accuracy. Conversely, the post-edited versions contained more errors at the levels of style and verity. Finally, the translators' views on MT and PE were dependent on the MT output quality, while their trust level in the output may have affected the end-product quality."

The framework is designed to address the needs of human users, journalists, academics, and the public to collect and analyze content from social media and the web in Spanish, Italian, Greek, and English, without prior training or a background in Computer Science. The backend functionality provides content collection and monitoring, semantic analysis including hate speech detection and sentiment analysis using machine learning models and rule-based algorithms, storing, querying, and retrieving such content along with the relevant metadata in a database. This functionality is assessed through a graphic user interface that is accessed using a web browser. An evaluation procedure was held through online questionnaires, including journalists and students, proving the feasibility of the use of the proposed framework by non-experts for the defined use-case scenarios."

We describe the design, methodological considerations and technical requirements regarding the application development, the elicitation tasks, materials and guidelines, as well as the implementation of the assessment procedure. To investigate the efficacy of remote elicitation of narrative discourse with the use of the technology-enhanced method presented here, a pilot study was conducted, aiming to compare narratives elicited remotely to narratives collected in an in-person elicitation mode from ten unimpaired adults, using a within-participants research design. In the remote elicitation setting, each participant performed the tasks of a narrative elicitation protocol via the web application in their own environment, with the assistance of an investigator in the context of a virtual meeting (video conferencing). In the in-person elicitation setting, the participant was in the same environment with the investigator, who administered the tasks using the web application. Data were manually transcribed, and transcripts were processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. Linguistic features representing key measures of spoken narrative discourse were automatically calculated: linguistic productivity, content richness, fluency, syntactic complexity at clausal and inter-clausal level, lexical diversity, and verbal output. The results show that spoken narratives produced by the same individuals in the two different experimental settings do not present significant differences regarding the linguistic variables analyzed, in sixty six out of seventy statistical tests. These results indicate that the presented web-based application is a feasible method for the remote collection of spoken narrative discourse from adults without language impairments in the context of online assessment."

The approach employs a deep learning scheme based on a machine learning model that uses several linguistic features and word embeddings, and is trained using two different kinds of ground truth: the size of words in characters and the use of freely available nautical dictionaries. In addition, the approach was able to extract a large number of domain-specific terms that were not included in existing dictionaries. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms human annotation when a semi-supervised method is used for ground truth. These results suggest that the proposed approach could be a useful tool for term extraction from legal documents in the shipping/maritime industry, and could potentially be adapted for other domains and languages as well."

We focus on the development of the fundamental tasks required by a conversational agent to provide customer services in the education industry and manage requests with instant responses and increased customer satisfaction. Instead of handling IE and NER separately, as it is common in the related work, we develop a joint model that combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layers and generates outputs both for IE and NER. We introduce a novel, open access dataset for customer services in education industry, the UniWay dataset, that has been used for training and evaluating our model, comprises students' questions in English and Greek about essential information related to their studies. A comparative evaluation of the proposed model versus state-of-the-art standalone and joint model solutions in UniWay and xSID datasets, results in improvement of the performance for the IE task up to 1.4% and it is on par with the state-of-the-art for the NER task. These results justify the intuition that closed domains can benefit from less sophisticated architectures, but less costly in terms of computational and memory resources, that jointly resolve multiple NLU tasks."

Automatic text summarization techniques can be highly beneficial as they save time, reduce costs, and lessen the cognitive load of legal professionals. However, applying these techniques to legal documents poses several challenges due to the complexity of legal documents and the lack of needed resources, especially in linguistically under-resourced languages, such as the Greek language. In this paper, we address automatic summarization of Greek legal documents. A major challenge in this area is the lack of suitable datasets in the Greek language. In response, we developed a new metadata-rich dataset consisting of selected judgments from the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece, alongside their reference summaries and category tags, tailored for the purpose of automated legal document summarization. We also adopted several state-of-the-art methods for abstractive and extractive summarization and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the methods using both human and automatic metrics. Our results: (i) revealed that, while extractive methods exhibit average performance, abstractive methods generate moderately fluent and coherent text, but they tend to receive low scores in relevance and consistency metrics; (ii) indicated the need for metrics that capture better a legal document summary’s coherence, relevance, and consistency; (iii) demonstrated that fine-tuning BERT models on a specific upstream task can significantly improve the model’s performance."

The potential to harness the plurality of available data in real time along with advanced data analytics for the accurate prediction of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks has gained significant scientific interest. Different methodologies based on the use of machine learning techniques and traditional and alternative data sources, such as ILI surveillance reports, weather reports, search engine queries, and social media, have been explored with the ultimate goal of being used in the development of electronic surveillance systems that could complement existing monitoring resources. Objective: The scope of this study was to investigate for the first time the combined use of ILI surveillance data, weather data, and Twitter data along with deep learning techniques toward the development of prediction models able to nowcast and forecast weekly ILI cases. By assessing the predictive power of both traditional and alternative data sources on the use case of ILI, this study aimed to provide a novel approach for corroborating evidence and enhancing accuracy and reliability in the surveillance of infectious diseases. Methods: The model’s input space consisted of information related to weekly ILI surveillance, web-based social (eg, Twitter) behavior, and weather conditions. For the design and development of the model, relevant data corresponding to the period of 2010 to 2019 and focusing on the Greek population and weather were collected. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were leveraged to efficiently handle the sequential and nonlinear nature of the multitude of collected data. The 3 data categories were first used separately for training 3 LSTM-based primary models. Subsequently, different transfer learning (TL) approaches were explored with the aim of creating various feature spaces combining the features extracted from the corresponding primary models’ LSTM layers for the latter to feed a dense layer. Results:The primary model that learned from weather data yielded better forecast accuracy (root mean square error [RMSE]=0.144; Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC]=0.801) than the model trained with ILI historical data (RMSE=0.159; PCC=0.794). The best performance was achieved by the TL-based model leveraging the combination of the 3 data categories (RMSE=0.128; PCC=0.822). Conclusions:The superiority of the TL-based model, which considers Twitter data, weather data, and ILI surveillance data, reflects the potential of alternative public sources to enhance accurate and reliable prediction of ILI spread. Despite its focus on the use case of Greece, the proposed approach can be generalized to other locations, populations, and social media platforms to support the surveillance of infectious diseases with the ultimate goal of reinforcing preparedness for future epidemics."

We show this bias via a novel method for comparing the fluency of multilingual models to the fluency of monolingual Spanish and Greek models: testing their preference for two carefully-chosen variable grammatical structures (optional pronoun-drop in Spanish and optional Subject-Verb ordering in Greek). We find that multilingual BERT is biased toward the English-like setting (explicit pronouns and Subject-Verb-Object ordering) as compared to our monolingual control language model. With our case studies, we hope to bring to light the fine-grained ways in which multilingual models can be biased, and encourage more linguistically-aware fluency evaluation."

We use zero-shot prompting with six popular LLMs and zero-shot learning with two task-specific fine-tuned BERT models, and we compare the results against those of the top-performing teams at the OffensEval competitions. Our results show that while some LMMs such as Flan-T5 achieve competitive performance, in general LLMs lag behind the best OffensEval systems."

Abstract: Media analysis (MA) is an evolving area of research in the field of text mining and an important research area for intelligent media analytics. The fundamental purpose of MA is to obtain valuable insights that help to improve many different areas of business, and ultimately customer experience, through the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments, and subjectivity on mostly highly subjective text types. These texts can come from social media, the internet, and news articles with clearly defined and unique targets. Additionally, MA-related fields include emotion, irony, and hate speech detection, which are usually tackled independently from one another without leveraging the contextual similarity between them, mainly attributed to the lack of annotated datasets. In this paper, we present a unified framework to the complete intelligent media analysis, where we propose a shared parameter layer architecture with a joint learning approach that takes advantage of each separate task for the classification of sentiments, emotions, irony, and hate speech in texts. The proposed approach was evaluated on Greek expert-annotated texts from social media posts, news articles, and internet articles such as blog posts and opinion pieces. The results show that this joint classification approach improves the classification effectiveness of each task in terms of the micro-averaged F1-score."

The task focused on news articles in nine languages (six known to the participants upfront: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, and Russian), and three additional ones revealed to the participants at the testing phase: Spanish, Greek, and Georgian). The task featured three subtasks: (1) determining the genre of the article (opinion, reporting, or satire), (2) identifying one or more frames used in an article from a pool of 14 generic frames, and (3) identify the persuasion techniques used in each paragraph of the article, using a taxonomy of 23 persuasion techniques. This was a very popular task: a total of 181 teams registered to participate, and 41 eventually made an official submission on the test set."

For that purpose, a simple artificial language was used and a systemic model of language communication. The robot, which was implemented through a computer simulation, is initially taught both the artificial language and the systemic model of human communication. The main goal of improvement was to allow a robot using the implied information of incoming sentences and ask questions whenever the given instructions are not complete. This process was based on the voids of an output data structure that corresponds to a systemic model of language communication, augmented with hole semantics, as grammar formalism, in order to handle partial/incomplete information. As expected, the improvement of learning abilities was observed. Some problems were also noticed in the process that had to be handled. This research comes to redefine the project in relation to these problems, as well as the final form of the language that was planned to be used. The usage of a dictionary of approximately 200 words in Greek natural language, the interchange of the programming language from Java to Python, as well as a new word learning procedures, are the new points in this paper. New words help the robot to expand the initial dictionary. The learning procedures start at the moment that a unknown word, included in a sentence addressed to the robot, arrives in its hearing input system. In addition, Python is an evolving programming language in various artificial intelligence's applications. Finally, the natural language helps in a more direct and friendly communication with most users, in free expressions with fewer restrictions."

The Financial Narrative summarisation Shared Task (FNS 2023) has been running since 2020 as part of the Financial Narrative Processing (FNP) workshop series [15–20]. The shared task included one main challenge, which is the use of either abstractive or extractive automatic summarisers to summarise long documents in terms of UK, Greek, and Spanish financial annual reports. This shared task is the fourth to target financial documents. The data for the shared task was created and collected from publicly available annual reports published by firms listed on the Stock Exchanges of the UK, Greece, and Spain. A total number of 6 systems from 3 different teams participated in the shared task."
