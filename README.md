# Towards Systematic Monolingual NLP Surveys: GenA of Greek NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has traditionally been predominantly focused on English,
driven by the availability of resources, the size of the research community, and market demands. Recently,
there has been a noticeable shift towards multilingualism in NLP, recognizing the need for inclusivity and
effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures. Monolingual surveys have the potential to complement
the broader trend towards multilingualism in NLP by providing foundational insights and resources necessary 
for effectively addressing the linguistic diversity of global communication. However, monolingual
NLP surveys are extremely rare in literature. This study introduces a method for creating systematic and
comprehensive monolingual NLP surveys, aimed at optimizing the process of constructing such surveys
and thoroughly addressing a languageâ€™s NLP capabilities. Characterized by a structured search protocol,
our method can be used to select publications and organize them through a taxonomy of NLP tasks.
We include a classification of Language Resources (LRs), according to their availability, and datasets,
according to their annotation, to highlight publicly-available and machine-actionable LRs. By applying
our method on Greek NLP from 2012 to 2023, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state
and challenges of Greek NLP research. We discuss the progress of Greek NLP and outline encountered Greek
LRs, classified by availability and usability. As we show, our proposed method helps avoid common pitfalls,
such as data leakage and contamination, and to assess language support per NLP task. The presented
systematic literature review of Greek NLP serves as an application of our method that showcases the benefits
of monolingual NLP surveys more broadly. Although the time-demanding nature of a literature review
prevents of us repeating our application for another language, we consider that applications of our method
can be considered for the myriads of languages whose progress in NLP lags behind that of well-supported
languages. Similar applications could be considered for the myriads of languages whose progress in NLP
lags behind that of well-supported languages.
